First Column: Activities - Activity Names: Walking, Standing, Sitting, Laying, Walking Downstairs, Walking Upstairs

Second Column: Subjects - People who tested with wearable tech. Values from 1 to 30. Each one is a different person.

Third Column: Mean of "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" values. Grouped by Activities and Subjects

Fourth and rest: Mean of the original values. Grouped by Activities and Subjects. 

I dont write one by one all the columns. They are all mean of the original values grouped by activities and subjects. 

For example: When we look at "tBodyAcc-mean()-X", It shows me the 5st(or other) person's mean "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" value. And this is for different activities. For exapmle in first data we had 30 "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" values for a person and for every single activity. Then we took the mean of those values and we also took the mean of the std values also.
